Description: Given a list of x,y coordinates: determine how many coordinates are exactly 1234 units apart. The solution must be able to be run in less than 5 seconds for 500,000 data points.

Input: Input will consist of a single integer n that states how many data points will follow. For each datapoint, there will be a (x, y) coordinate that is space separated followed by a newline and can be read in via standard input (you can use cin). Or read from a file. The file will have a line such as: 2 4

Input constraints:
0 <= x < 1,000,000
0 <= y < 1,000,000
0 < n < 1,000,000

Output: Output should consist of a single integer saying how many points are exactly 1234 units apart from each other.
